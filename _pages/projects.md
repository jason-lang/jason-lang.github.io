*   The _**Jason**_\-Cartago combination has generated two excellent projects:
*   *   [JaCa-Android](https://web.archive.org/web/20230108225506/http://jaca-android.sourceforge.net/ "http://jaca-android.sourceforge.net/")

*   There is an interface between _**Jason**_ and Cartago, available [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20230108225506/http://alice.unibo.it/xwiki/bin/view/CARTAGO/C4Jason "http://alice.unibo.it/xwiki/bin/view/CARTAGO/C4Jason").
*   J-Moise allows _**Jason**_ agents to use [Moise+](https://web.archive.org/web/20230108225506/http://sourceforge.net/projects/moise "http://sourceforge.net/projects/moise") organisations (available with the _**Jason**_ distribution).
*   In a _**Jason**_ customisation, the concept of _graded beliefs_ is used to make it possible for agents to handle uncertainty in reasoning and belief revision. More details are available [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20230108225506/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/347963965_Graded_Belief_Revision_for_Jason_A_Rule-Based_Approach).

If you know of other projects using or extending _**Jason**_, please [let us know](https://web.archive.org/web/20230108225506/mailto:jason.developers@gmail.com?subject=Jason%20Website:%20projects%20using%20Jason "mailto:jason.developers@gmail.com?subject=Jason Website: projects using Jason").
